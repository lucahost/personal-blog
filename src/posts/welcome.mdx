# Welcome to the Modern Blog

This blog has been completely modernized with the latest technologies:

## Features

- **React 18** with the latest features
- **Vite** for lightning-fast builds
- **TypeScript 5** for better type safety
- **React Router v6** for modern routing
- **MDX** for rich content authoring

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```tsx
function Welcome() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <p>This is rendered from MDX!</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## What's Next?

You can now write blog posts in MDX format with:

- Syntax highlighting
- React components
- Markdown features
- Frontmatter metadata

> This is a blockquote to show the styling works!
